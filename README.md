Hello,
This was a project that I made for my Data Mining Assignment wherein I scrapped data pertaining to house pricing from nobroker.com.
This data was then used to train a Logistic Regression Model which predicts house pricing based on the BHK, Area, Locality and number of bathrooms.
A GUI was also made regarding the same which allowed the user to select the options for prediction purposes.
